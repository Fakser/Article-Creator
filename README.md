# ArticleCreator
Probably all IT students one day have to create a boring report about some topic. 
Sometimes as an employee of IT company you are 'kindly asked' to write similar article/paper that no one will read, 
but it will look very professional on their webpage. And sometimes instead of searching throught the internet for 
information about something that you know nothing about is pretty boring.  You probably would prefer to play Fortnite 
and watch anime. 

And what we do with boring responisibilites?

Yes, exactly, we automate them.

Thus i would like to introduce my personal Report writer aka Article creator. 

*PART 1* Usage:

1. download repository
2. install all requiered libraries (virtualenv will be added soon)
3. from command line/anaconda prompt/powershell/: [path to this repository on your pc] python script.py "HERE PUT THE TITLE OF YOUR ARTICLE"
4. Wait some time, on my coputere average waiting time is around 40 seconds
5. Hey, suddenly some new file called 'report.docx' appeared in the repository folder, oh my lord it is fully working shitty article with stupid headers and even photos how the hell does it work?

(Description will be added soon)
